# Learning Cycle Animation Symbols

## 1. Classical Greek Period (5th-2nd BCE)
### Central Building:
The Parthenon or simplified Greek temple featuring:
- Iconic columned facade (Doric style)
- Triangular pediment
- Wide stone steps leading up
- Minimalist geometric design

### Central Figures:
Three robed philosophers in togas:
- One teaching/gesturing (representing dialectic)
- One writing on scroll (representing documentation)
- One demonstrating with geometric tools (representing empirical study)

### Knowledge Symbols:
- Pythagorean theorem (right triangle)
- Platonic solids
- Logical syllogism diagram
- Astronomical circles

### AI Visualization Prompt:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of an ancient Greek temple scene. The temple should have clean Doric columns, a triangular pediment, and wide stone steps. In front of it, position three philosophers in flowing togas - one gesturing as if teaching, one seated writing on a scroll, and one using geometric tools. Use simple lines, maintain classical proportions, and keep the style elegant and understated. The scene should evoke the academic atmosphere of ancient Greek philosophy."

## 2. Renaissance Period (14th-16th)
### Central Building:
Monastery or Cathedral featuring:
- Gothic architecture with pointed arches
- Central courtyard/cloister
- Library/scriptorium
- Observatory tower

### Central Figures:
Three scholars in medieval/renaissance garb:
- Monk with manuscript (representing preservation)
- Artist with tools (representing observation)
- Scholar with instruments (representing measurement)

### Knowledge Symbols:
- Perspective drawing grid
- Anatomical sketches
- Mechanical diagrams
- Celestial charts

### AI Visualization Prompt:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of a medieval monastery complex with Gothic architecture. Focus on the key architectural elements: pointed arches framing doorways and windows, a serene square cloister courtyard with covered walkways, and a distinctive astronomical tower rising above. Include a library wing with tall windows and a scriptorium space. The style should emphasize clean architectural lines and medieval precision, using simple geometric shapes to capture the essence of Gothic design. Maintain architectural accuracy while keeping ornamentation minimal and stylized."

## 3. Modern Scientific Period (19th-21st)
### Central Building:
Contemporary Research Institute featuring:
- Clean glass and steel facade
- Open atrium with natural light
- Integrated garden spaces
- Modern laboratory wings

### Central Figures:
Three modern researchers:
- Scientist in lab coat (representing experimentation)
- Theorist at blackboard (representing mathematics)
- Tech researcher at computer (representing computation)

### Knowledge Symbols:
- Quantum wave function
- DNA double helix
- Binary code
- Neural network diagram

### AI Visualization Prompt:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of a contemporary research institute. Feature a balanced composition of glass and steel with clean geometric lines. Include a striking central atrium filled with natural light, flanked by modern laboratory wings. The design should incorporate subtle curves and thoughtful asymmetry while maintaining a sense of purpose and stability. Add integrated garden spaces and environmental design elements that complement rather than dominate the architecture. The building should feel modern and innovative while remaining grounded and functional. Use a mix of transparent and solid elements to create visual interest while keeping the overall style clean and sophisticated."

## Historical Figures Prompts

### Classical Greek Period Figures:

#### Plato:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Plato in flowing Greek robes. He should be holding a book and pointing upward with his other hand, symbolizing his theory of forms. His pose should be dignified and philosophical, with clean lines maintaining classical proportions. His beard and features should be simplified but recognizable from classical busts."

#### Aristotle:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Aristotle in traditional Greek dress. He should be shown in an observational stance with one hand extended horizontally, representing his empirical approach. Include subtle details of his characteristic features while keeping the style clean and elegant. His pose should suggest active engagement with the physical world."

#### Pythagoras:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Pythagoras in classical Greek attire. Show him demonstrating with geometric tools, particularly focused on a right triangle. His expression should convey deep concentration, with simplified but distinctive ancient Greek styling. Include basic geometric shapes around him while maintaining clean, minimal lines."

### Renaissance Period Figures:

#### Leonardo da Vinci:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Leonardo da Vinci in 15th-century Florentine dress. Show him with his characteristic notebook and measuring tools, capturing his observant expression and flowing beard. Include subtle references to his technical drawings while keeping the overall style clean and precise."

#### Galileo Galilei:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Galileo in 16th-century Italian scholarly attire. Depict him with his telescope and celestial charts, emphasizing his astronomical observations. His pose should suggest scientific inquiry, with his characteristic features simplified but recognizable."

#### Copernicus:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Copernicus in Renaissance academic robes. Show him studying astronomical models, particularly a heliocentric system diagram. His expression should convey deep contemplation, with period-appropriate details in clothing while maintaining clean, elegant lines."

### Modern Scientific Period Figures:

#### Albert Einstein:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Einstein at a chalkboard with E=mcÂ² written behind him. Include his characteristic wild hair and mustache, casual sweater, and thoughtful expression. The style should be clean and modern while capturing his iconic appearance and the essence of theoretical physics."

#### Marie Curie:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Marie Curie in her laboratory. Show her working with glowing test tubes and early radiation equipment. Include her period-appropriate dress and determined expression. The style should be clean and scientific, with subtle lighting effects from the radioactive materials."

#### Alan Turing:
"Create a minimalist vector illustration of Alan Turing at an early computing machine. Show him in his characteristic casual academic attire, deeply focused on the machine's output. Include simplified representations of early computer components while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic that emphasizes the pioneering nature of his work."

## Visualization Notes:
- Buildings should be simplified to iconic silhouettes
- Figures should be generic but instantly recognizable by clothing/pose
- Each period's visual style should be distinct but harmonious
- Use consistent line weight and minimal detail for clarity
- Consider using period-appropriate decorative elements as frames
