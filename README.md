The Learning cycle, spanning approximately 250 years, is a concept in civilizational theory that focuses on the accumulation and transformation of knowledge across generations. While less formally defined than some other cycles, it encompasses:

1. Acquisition of new knowledge
2. Integration of knowledge into existing systems
3. Transformation of societal structures based on new understanding
4. Crisis or limitation of current knowledge paradigm
5. Emergence of new questions or challenges

Examples of learning cycles in history:

- Classical Greek philosophy to Hellenistic science (5th century BCE - 2nd century CE)
- Medieval scholasticism to Renaissance humanism (11th - 16th centuries)
- Enlightenment to Industrial Revolution (17th - 19th centuries)
- Modern science to Information Age (19th - 21st centuries)

This cycle highlights the role of knowledge and learning in shaping civilizational development and provides a framework for understanding long-term intellectual and cultural trends.
